# Reverse-Shell-Using-Digispark
This is an Arduino script for attiny85 digispark to get a reverse shell from your target. The script installs a payload on the target system that bypasses most AVs including windows defender and runs the payload to get a reverse shell.  Works both locally and through internet ( with tunnelling through ngrok ).
